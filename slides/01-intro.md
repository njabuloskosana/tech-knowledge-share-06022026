## Building with AI: Practical Tools in Action

Today we're going to build something together  using nothing but words.

No code. No design skills. Just clear communication with AI.

## What's on the Menu

| Part | Topic | What You'll See |
|------|-------|-----------------|
|  | **Love & Lovable** | Building a Valentine's app that makes it impossible to say no |
|  | **Art & Gemini** | Creating a romantic comic with AI |
|  | **For the Techies** | Advanced prompt engineering (XML, chain-of-thought) |

## The Big Idea

Vague prompt = generic result.

Detailed, structured prompt = exactly what you imagined.

**Today you'll learn how to get exactly what you want from AI.**

*Have you ever wanted to ask someone to be your Valentine but needed the perfect way to do it?*

What if you could build a web app for that... in 5 minutes?

**Let's see how.**
