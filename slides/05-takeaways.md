## What We Learned (Lovable Edition)

### 1. Quality In = Quality Out

Your prompt is your product spec.
Invest 5 minutes in your prompt, save 5 hours of iteration.

### 2. The 5-Part Framework Works

| Principle | Remember |
|-----------|----------|
| **Specific** | Exact details, not vibes |
| **Structured** | Clear sections with headers |
| **Examples** | Show, don't just tell |
| **Steps** | Build incrementally |
| **Refine** | Iterate with precision |

### 3. Think Like a Designer

Include:
- What it looks like (colors, layout, animations)
- What it does (interactions, flows, states)
- How it feels (playful? professional? romantic?)
