## The Idea

A playful web app where you create a personalized Valentine's card and share it with your crush.

**The twist?** The 'No' button runs away. Literally.

---

## What We're Building

**Creator Mode:**
- Upload a photo of you two
- Add their name
- Get a shareable link

**Recipient Mode:**
- They open your link
- See the personalized card
- Try (and fail) to click 'No'
- Celebrate when they click 'Yes'!

## The Star Feature: The Runaway Button 

When they hover over 'No':
1. The button grows cartoon legs
2. It runs to a random position
3. Text changes: 'No' -> 'Nope!' -> 'Really?' -> 'Can't catch me!' -> 'NEVER!'
4. Color shifts: purple -> orange -> red (panic mode!)

**Result:** It's impossible to say no.

## The Yes Flow

**First Yes:** 'Wait really?!  You love me that much?'

**Second Yes:** Celebration screen with 'I Love You!' and animated hearts everywhere!

---

## The Vibe

- Warm romantic gradients (pinks, magentas, soft corals)
- Floating rose petals
- Twinkling sparkles
- Playful but heartfelt

**No backend needed** - everything encoded in the URL!

## How Do We Tell an AI All This?

This is complex:
- Multiple screens and states
- Specific animations
- Exact text sequences
- Technical requirements
