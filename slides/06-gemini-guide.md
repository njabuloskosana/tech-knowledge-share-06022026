## Same Principles, Different Canvas

Everything we learned about prompting Lovable works for AI art too.

**Be specific. Add structure. Give examples. Refine and repeat.**

---

## Our Projects: Valentine's AI Art

We created **two complementary pieces** using the same prompting principles:

1. **The 3-Panel Comic**  The full romantic story
2. **The Grand Gesture**  Just the roses moment

*Let's see both prompts in action.*

## Prompt #1: The 3-Panel Story

```
Generate a three-panel romantic editorial cartoon in Zapiro's style:

Panel 1 - 'The Preparation': Njabulo nervously preparing at 
Sandton City - arranging rose petals, setting up balloons,

holding a rose. Thought bubble: 'You've got this!' 
                                  ↑ [1: Be Specific - Exact dialogue]

          ↑ [1: Be Specific - Exact emotional response]

paper with flowing gold ribbons. Her face lit up with pure joy 
and surprise - eyes wide behind her glasses, huge genuine smile, 
hands reaching out excitedly or clasped to her chest in delighted 
shock. Small hearts floating around her head. His proud, happy

## Why Both Prompts Work

**Prompt #1 (3-Panel Comic):**
- **Structured:** Clear panel breakdown with narrative arc
- **Specific:** Exact captions, locations, emotions per panel
- **Examples:** 'Zapiro-style', specific color palette

**Prompt #2 (Single Frame Roses):**
- **Character detail:** Precise physical descriptions (afro, braids, glasses, clothing)
- **Scene composition:** Exact positioning, expressions, background elements
- **Specific:** Bouquet size (2-3 dozen), wrapping details (gold ribbons)
- **Style notes:** 'No text, captions, or price tags - purely visual'

**Both demonstrate:** Be specific. Add structure. Give examples.  Get exactly what you imagine.

---

## Pro Tips for AI Art

- **Upload reference photos** for character likeness
- **Name a specific style** ('Zapiro-style', 'Studio Ghibli', 'Pixar')
- **Specify colors** exactly ('soft pinks, warm golds')
- **Include technical specs** (4:3 ratio, professional quality)
- **Iterate with precision** ('Make her smile bigger', 'Add more hearts')

---

## Common Refinements

**Characters off:** 'Adjust facial features to match the reference photo'

**Too digital:** 'More hand-drawn with visible ink strokes and watercolor texture'

**Emotions unclear:** 'Make her expression more joyful - eyes lighting up'

**Colors wrong:** 'Warmer palette with more romantic pinks and sunset golds'

---

## When to Use This Approach

Perfect for:
-  **Budget-conscious romantics**  NetFlorist who?
-  **Creative proposals**  Stand out from the generic
-  **Personalized gifts**  Something truly one-of-a-kind
-  **Anniversary cards**  Show effort over expense

*Pro tip: She'll appreciate the creativity more than the price tag.*

**Now let's talk to the techies...**
