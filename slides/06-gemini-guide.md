## Same Principles, Different Canvas

Everything we learned about prompting Lovable works for AI art too.

**Be specific. Add structure. Give examples. Refine and repeat.**

## Our Project: A Valentine's Comic

A 3-panel romantic cartoon showing:
1. **The Preparation** - Setting up the perfect moment
2. **The Ask** - Presenting the rose
3. **The Yes** - Celebration!

*Let's see how to prompt this.*

## The Prompt That Works

\\\
Generate a three-panel romantic editorial cartoon in Zapiro's style:

Panel 1 - 'The Preparation': Njabulo nervously preparing at 
Sandton City - arranging rose petals, setting up balloons, 
holding a rose. Thought bubble: 'You've got this!' 
Johannesburg skyline in background.
Caption: 'When you know she's the one...'

Panel 2 - 'The Perfect Moment': Beautiful setup complete.
Njabulo presenting the rose as she approaches. 
Warm golden-hour lighting. 
Caption: 'Sometimes dreams do come true...'

Panel 3 - 'She Says Yes!': Close-up of both - him holding 
the rose: 'Will you be my Valentine?' Her glowing: 
'Yes! A thousand times yes!' Hearts floating everywhere.
Caption: 'For Siphosihle, with all my heart - Valentine's 2026'

Style: Zapiro-style editorial cartoon, bold ink lines, 
watercolor tones (soft pinks, warm golds, romantic reds),
exaggerated but tender caricature, 4:3 ratio.

## Why This Works

**Specific:** Names, location (Sandton City), exact dialogue, expressions

**Structured:** Clear panel breakdown with distinct purposes

**Examples:** 'Zapiro-style', 'Johannesburg skyline', specific colors

**Emotional arc:** Preparation -> Perfect moment -> Joyful acceptance

## Pro Tips for AI Art

- **Upload reference photos** for character likeness
- **Name a specific style** ('Zapiro-style', 'Studio Ghibli', 'Pixar')
- **Specify colors** exactly ('soft pinks, warm golds')
- **Include technical specs** (4:3 ratio, professional quality)
- **Iterate with precision** ('Make her smile bigger', 'Add more hearts')

---

## Common Refinements

**Characters off:** 'Adjust facial features to match the reference photo'

**Too digital:** 'More hand-drawn with visible ink strokes and watercolor texture'

**Emotions unclear:** 'Make her expression more joyful - eyes lighting up'

**Colors wrong:** 'Warmer palette with more romantic pinks and sunset golds'

---

## The Result

A unique, personalized piece of art.

Perfect for:
- Valentine's cards
- Anniversary gifts
- Proposal accessories
- Just because you love someone
