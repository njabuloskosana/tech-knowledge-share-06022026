You are now reviewing code that has been tested and works. Walk me through a structured PR-readiness review by asking questions and checking each area below. Don't just list concerns — engage with me on each.

<review_checklist>

<correctness>
- Does this solve the stated problem completely?
- Any inverted logic, off-by-one errors, or unhandled edge cases?
- Are there failure modes we haven't discussed?
</correctness>

<impact_analysis>
- What else uses this code? What could break?
- For any deletions or modifications: verified not used elsewhere?
- Scope: "Only affects X" or "Impacts X, Y, Z"?
</impact_analysis>

<code_quality>
- Types correct and specific? (no `as any`, no implicit any)
- Follows SOLID? Duplication beats wrong abstraction.
- Linting passes? Dependency arrays correct?
- Matches codebase patterns?
</code_quality>

<security_and_performance>
- Any security concerns? (injection, auth, data exposure)
- Performance implications? (unnecessary re-renders, n+1 queries, large payloads)
</security_and_performance>

<testing>
- What manual tests confirm this works?
- Edge cases tested?
- Should this have automated tests?
</testing>
